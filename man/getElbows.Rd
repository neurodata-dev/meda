\title{Given a decreasingly sorted vector, return the given number of elbows}
\usage{
getElbows(dat, n = 3, threshold = FALSE, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{a input vector (e.g. a vector of standard deviations), or a input feature matrix.}

\item{n}{the number of returned elbows.}

\item{threshold}{either FALSE or a number. If threshold is a number, then 
all the elements in d that are not larger than the threshold will be ignored.}

\item{plot}{logical. When TRUE, it depicts a scree plot with highlighted elbows.}
}
\value{
q a vector of length n.
}
\description{
Given a decreasingly sorted vector, return the given number of elbows
}
\details{
Computes the "elbows" as defined in Zhu and Ghodsi 2006.

\examples{
v <- sort(runif(25), decreasing = TRUE)
#v <- prcomp(iris[, -5])$sd
getElbows(v)
